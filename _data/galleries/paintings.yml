- caption: "\u201CSleep\u201D is a very peaceful state. For me, that is the only state\
    \ where we look like we are part of nature. That calmness and stableness is hard\
    \ to find when we are awake. Too often we are tied up with meetings, with phone\
    \ calls, and with social media. We try to achieve success quickly, but not so\
    \ elegantly, so swiftly. While we are being consumed in this busy lifestyle, we\
    \ stop to think about the pace of nature and appreciate the art of stillness.\
    \ I want to record down the scene where one is sleeping. Using the familiar colours\
    \ of a tree, green brown and yellow, to represent both the figure and nature.\
    \ The box on the right hand side shows the irony of how we are always on the move,\
    \ yet we are trapped in a box. I hope this painting can remind the audience to\
    \ stop and appreciate a slow paced life."

- caption: This is my portrayal of how a romantic and ideal artist would be. In the
    rain, curled hair and muscles that are grown due to labour. Vibrant colours reflect
    the mind of the artist. The artist is not impacted by the moody weather nor the
    work. The artist is hopeful and eager to share all his/her knowledge and thoughts.
    The artist listens and absorbs the ideas and wisdoms from encounters. Endure life
    in delight is the most artistic way of living.

- caption: Based on a photograph of my partner when he was nearly two years old. Red,
    blue and yellow, these are the primary colours. In addition, they are also the
    colours of childhood in general. I want this painting to remind the audience of
    their childhood, the age of fun, innocence, and laughter.

- caption: 'This painting aims to express loneliness of an aged man. The man is alone
    in a snow field where there stands a tree without any leaves. There is nothing
    else but snow and stormy weather ahead of the man, yet he is determined to walk
    towards the unknown. Perhaps he knows where he is going, but we do not know what
    is waiting for him. He will be facing it alone in the cold with no one to rely
    on.

    a wine tasting room, drinking portugese wine for the first time. Alcohol is an
    interesting substance, it releases your stress, relaxes your sights, and takes
    you to a world of wonder.

- caption: "Living abroad, I have met many people that imagine Taiwan as a tropical\
    \ island that is full of beaches and palm trees. Taiwan does have beautiful beaches\
    \ and coast lines. However, more of its area is covered by mountains. In fact,\
    \ the tallest mountain in Taiwan, the Mount Jade, is actually higher than the\
    \ Pyr\xE9n\xE9es! This painting hopes to reveal the mountaineous sights of Taiwan\
    \ to those who are unfamiliar. This is Tataka, a location that is close to the\
    \ entry point of Mount Jade. I hope one day you will have the chance to see the\
    \ beauty for yourself!"

    It is especially inspired by her collection of short stories, Stories of the Sahara.
    Reading her stories is just like falling into an unimaginable fantasy. I felt
    as if I have traveled, discovered and adventured the Sahara. If I am to picture
    it, I would be like this. '

- caption: In Taiwan, Mother's day is always the second Sunday of May. Traditionally,
    children are to give carnation to their mother as a present. Red carnations are
    most popular as red represents luck, happiness and blessings. Carnations are indeed
    beautiful, but it is tiresome to gift the same flower every year. Hence, here
    is a flower that looks like the result of mixing carnation with rose. I included
    the element of rose to amplify the message of love to my mom. These flowers are
    full of life, and are growing. I want to spread the message that appreciation
    and love should not only be expressed by message of a moment. Continuous expression
    is more meaningful.

    times in summer, my taste buds would crave tastes of acidity so badly. Adding
    lemons in every dish seems normal to me. Are you also someone who loves lemons?
    You are memorized by its flavour or its colours and shape? '
